\section*{Instructions}

Carefully read the questions before you start answering them.
Note the time limit of the exam and plan your answers accordingly.
(The questions are \emph{not} sorted by difficulty.)
Only answer the question, do not write about subjects remotely related to the
question.

Make sure you follow these rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Write your answers on separate sheets, not on the exam paper.
  \item Only write on one side of the sheets.
  \item Start each question on a new sheet.
  \item Do not forget to \emph{motivate your answers.}
\end{itemize}

Make sure you write your answers clearly: if the examiner cannot read an 
answer, the answer will be awarded zero(!) points --- even if the answer is 
correct.

\subsection*{Grading}

Each question is worth three (3) points, representing how well you fulfil the 
intended learning outcomes covered by the question.
The following grading criteria applies:
\begin{description}
  \item[E] at least one point on each question.
  \item[D] closer to C than E.
  \item[C] at least two points on each question.
  \item[B] closer to A than C.
  \item[A] at least three points on each question.
